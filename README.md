**Cook Coverver** is an iOS/iPadOS app that converts some units of measurement for you in order to make your life in the kitchen a little easier :)

This project was developed as a personal exercise so that I can familiarize myself with SwiftUI & Combine Frameworks and still practice some old but important features, such as localization, SwiftLint, SwiftGen, XCTest and some other things from iOS.

The app is available in pt-BR and en-US with some other supported languages ​​planned.

Feel free to clone the project and use it as an example to study the Frameworks used, it is a pleasure to help you :)

Feedbacks are also welcome !!!!

Then, download **Cook Converver** [from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/culiversor/id1543824498) and forget how many tablespoons you need to measure 300g of butter !!!
